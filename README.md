# Anureet Aviation Center

Anureet avaitaion center sells the airplane models to airplane companies. Every user has its own username and password.
By entering the username, password (for example: username is "jim@home.com" and password is "123456")and clicking the sign in button the user is able to see all the models that are on sale at that particular time. 

## What I learnt from this

This work was focused on authentication for username and password. By working on this I learnt how to authenticate the user using Firebase. I also learnt how nested route works.
